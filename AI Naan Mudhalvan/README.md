# Create a Chatbot using Python

This is a project of Artificial Intelligence Naan Mudhalvan Course.

**Problem Statement:** 

When using an app or website, customers expect outstanding service. They can become disinterested in the app if they can't locate the solution to a question they have. To avoid losing customers and having an adverse effect on your bottom line, you must provide the highest quality service possible while developing a website or application.

## Project Steps


**Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking**

Problem Definition:The challenge is to create a chatbot in Python that provides exceptional customer service, answering user queries on a website or application. The objective is to deliver high-quality support to users, ensuring a positive user experience and customer satisfaction.

**Design Thinking:**

*Functionality:* Define the scope of the chatbot's abilities, including answering common questions, providing guidance, and directing users to appropriate resources.

*User Interface:* Determine where the chatbot will be integrated (website, app) and design a user-friendly interface for interactions.

*Natural Language Processing (NLP):* Implement NLP techniques to understand and process user input in a conversational manner.

*Responses:* Plan responses that the chatbot will offer, such as accurate answers, suggestions, and assistance.

*Integration:* Decide how the chatbot will be integrated with the website or app.

*Testing and Improvement:* Continuously test and refine the chatbot's performance based on user interactions.

**Phase 2: Innovation**

In this phase, consider exploring advanced techniques like using pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT-3) to enhance the quality of responses.

**Phase 3: Development**

Start building the chatbot by preparing the environment and implementing basic user interactions.

**Phase 4: Development**

Continue building the chatbot by integrating it into a web app using Flask.

**Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission**

Document the project and prepare it for submission.
